# password-generator
A random password generator with customization options for different levels of complexity.

I intend to take this project further along once I learn some back-end skills. The goal is to give users the ability to
log in to the app, generate new passwords, and easily assign them to sites and store them to be pulled later, like a password
management system. This will always be open-source and available to the public.

The current build of the site is live at https://passwordify.netlify.app.

If you have experience with securing web apps or would like to help with the future of this project, please get in touch.
