# Passwordify
Passwordify is a full-stack password generation app which allows users to log in, generate passwords, associate them with services, and reference them as needed. All passwords are stored securely.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, React

The user has options at their disposal to customize passwords as much as they want, including whitelisting/blacklisting of selected characters, character limits, uppercase/lowercase specification, and number selection. Passwords may be referenced to specific sites and referenced as needed. This site is powered through fawazsullia's password generation API hosted here: https://github.com/fawazsullia/password-generator

## Optimizations

While this project is serviceable and may be used for sites that do not hold sensitive user information, this should not be used on more sensitive sites such as those for banking or federal sites. The encryption and security of the login system is not as rigorous as those made by large companies and has the potential to be bypassed if attempted by the wrong person. This should be looked at by someone with more cybersecurity experience in the future.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was my first attempt at managing user login systems and integration of API's. Work should be done to ensure that services that involve password management should be kept as secure as possible, as they may be difficult to market if this is not easily provable.
